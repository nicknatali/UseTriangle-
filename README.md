# UseTriangle-
Assignment 1 for Dr. Kolta's Software Quality Assurance and Testing course. 

The bugs I have already found but feel free to continue to work through are: 
Cannot enter too small of numbers
User could enter more than one number after any of the prompts and it will not be calculated
It doesn’t tell the user that negative numbers are not an option if a user tries to enter a negative number. 
Program crashes if letters are entered.
When decimals below one are entered, it doesn’t express what triangle it is. 

It will be a blessing to work with you sir. Let me know if there is anything more that I can do to help.
